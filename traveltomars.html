    Some evidence of audible communication is associated with the Martian Fighting-Machine, which are described emitting siren-like calls, and the repeated "Ulla, ulla" call (similar to a distress signal) that echoes throughout London after the mass death from bacterial infection of the Martians.
    It is widly well known that Martians are killed by terrestrial bacterias or singing.
    Despite their advancement, the Martians' technology lacks the wheel, and it is implied they are ignorant of disease and decomposition. It is theorized that their advanced technology eliminated whatever indigenous diseases were present on Mars, and so they no longer remembered their effects. Ultimately, their lack of knowledge or preparation against any bacteria indigenous to Earth, causes their destruction here (though they may have successfully invaded Venus) by what Wells described as "putrefactive bacteria," which digests organic materials upon death.
